**The KMeans clustering with the Iris dataset**(Feb 2023-March 2023)
This Project is a classic example of unsupervised learning, where the goal is to group similar data points into clusters without using predefined labels. The Iris dataset is commonly used for this task because it contains easily interpretable data, consisting of measurements for three species of iris flowers.

Here’s a breakdown of how to apply the KMeans algorithm on the Iris dataset in an unsupervised learning project:

1. Iris Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains:

150 instances of iris flowers.
4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
3 species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica (though in unsupervised learning, we won't use these labels directly for training).
2. KMeans Clustering
KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that aims to partition the data into k clusters. Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster center (centroid). The goal is to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their nearest cluster centroid.

The key parameters for KMeans:

k (number of clusters): We need to specify how many clusters the algorithm should form. For the Iris dataset,
